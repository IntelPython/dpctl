Welcome to Data-parallel Control (dpctl)'s documentation!
=========================================================

Data-parallel control (dpctl) is a library that exposes SYCL and DPCPP to
languages other than C++. Currently, dpctl provides SYCL bindings for C and
Python making it possible to access SYCL runtime objects and methods from these
languages. The SYCL functionality covered by dpctl includes the core SYCL 
runtime classes described in Section 4.6 of the 
`SYCL 2020 spec <https://www.khronos.org/registry/SYCL/specs/sycl-2020/html/sycl-2020.html#_sycl_runtime_classes>`_ 
and USM memory management. dpctl also has experimental support for SYCL's 
``kernel`` and ``program`` classes.
