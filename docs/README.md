What?
=====

Generator scripts for dpCtl API documentation. To run these scripts, follow
the following steps:
```bash
cd dpctl/docs
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DDPCTL_DOCGEN_PREFIX=<WHERE_YOU_WANT_DOCS_TO_BE_GENERATED> ..
make Sphinx
```

The `DPCTL_DOCGEN_PREFIX` flag is optional and can be omitted to generate the
documents in the current source directory in a sub-directory called
`generated_docs`.

The `make Sphinx` command will generate standalone Doxygen documentation and
a consolidated Sphix documentation for both dpCtl Python and C APIs.

Prerequisite
============

Before you generate the documentation make sure you have the following
packages installed:

- sphinx
- doxygen
- breathe
- exhale
