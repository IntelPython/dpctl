Welcome to Data-parallel Control (dpctl)'s documentation!
=========================================================

Data-parallel control (``dpctl``) is a library that exposes SYCL and DPCPP to
languages other than C++. Currently, ``dpctl`` provides SYCL bindings for C and
Python making it possible to access SYCL runtime objects and methods from these
languages. The SYCL functionality covered by ``dpctl`` includes the core SYCL runtime classes described in Section 4.6 of the `SYCL 2020 spec <https://www.khronos.org/registry/SYCL/specs/sycl-2020/html/sycl-2020.html#_sycl_runtime_classes>`_ and USM memory management. ``Dpctl`` also has experimental support for DPCPP ``kernel`` and ``program`` classes.
