Platform
########

In dpctl, the class :class:`dpctl.SyclPlatform` represents a platform and
abstracts the `sycl::platform`_ SYCL runtime class. A platform abstracts one or
more XPU that is connected to the host and that can be used for computation. The
platforms queryable using dpctl depends on the device drivers that are installed
on a system. A single driver may control multiple physical XPU, thus a platform
may also consist of multiple XPUs.

The platforms available on a system can be queried using the
:func:`dpctl.lsplatform` function. In addition, as illustrated in the following
example it is possible to print out metadata about a platform.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/python/lsplatform.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: # START
    :end-before: # END

The example is can be executed as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    python dpctl/examples/python/lsplatform.py -r all

The possible output for the example may be:

.. program-output:: python ../examples/python/lsplatform.py -r all

.. Note::
    The verbosity for the output can be controlled using the ``verbosity``
    keyword argument. Refer :func:`dpctl.lsplatform`.
