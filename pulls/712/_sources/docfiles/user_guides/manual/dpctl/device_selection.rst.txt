Device Selection
################

Device selection is the most fundamental operation provided by dpctl. Most
other operations, such as queue creation and kernel submission, depend on first
selecting a device. Dpctl offers several ways to programmatically select a
device that are discussed in this section.

Selecting a specific type of device
-----------------------------------

If a user needs to select a specific type of device such as a GPU, they can
directly use one of the helper functions included inside dpctl. Dpctl includes
:ref:`helper functions <dpctl_device_selection_functions>` for selecting
a ``host``, a ``cpu``, a ``gpu``, an ``accelerator``, or the ``default`` device.
These functions are analogous to SYCL's built-in `sycl::device_selector`_
classes. The scoring and selection of a specific device when multiple devices of
the same type are available on a system is deferred to the underlying SYCL
runtime.
