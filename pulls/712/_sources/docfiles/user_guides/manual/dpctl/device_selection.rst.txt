Device Selection
################

Device selection is the most fundamental operation provided by dpctl. Most
other operations, such as queue creation and kernel submission, depend on first
selecting a device. Dpctl offers several ways to programmatically select a
device that are discussed in this section.

Selecting a Specific Type of Device
-----------------------------------

If a user needs to select a specific type of device such as a GPU, they can
directly use one of the helper functions included inside dpctl. Dpctl includes
:ref:`helper functions <dpctl_device_selection_functions>` for selecting
a ``host``, a ``cpu``, a ``gpu``, an ``accelerator``, or the ``default`` device.
These functions are analogous to SYCL's built-in `sycl::device_selector`_
classes. The scoring and selection of a specific device when multiple devices of
the same type are available on a system is deferred to the underlying SYCL
runtime.

The example :ref:`fig-gpu-device-selection` shows the usage of the
:func:`dpctl.select_gpu_device()` device selection function. In case multiple
GPU devices are available, only one is returned based on the underlying scoring
logic inside the SYCL runtime. If the selection function was unable to select a
device a ``ValueError`` is raised.

    :language: python
    :lines: 20-21, 38-52

A possible output for the example :ref:`fig-gpu-device-selection` may be:

.. program-output:: python ../examples/python/device_selection.py -r create_gpu_device

Selecting a Device Using a Filter String
----------------------------------------

Along with using the default device selection functions, a more explicit way of
device selection involves the use of *filter strings* (refer
`oneAPI filter selection extension`_). The example
:ref:`fig-gpu-device-selection` also demonstrates the use of a filter string
to create a GPU device directly. Using a filter string allows much more
fine-grained control for selecting a device. The following example
:ref:`fig-filter-selection` demonstrates usages of device selection using filter
strings.

.. _fig-filter-selection:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../examples/python/filter_selection.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 20-21, 23-53
    :caption: Device Creation With Filter Strings
    :linenos:

A possible output for the example :ref:`fig-filter-selection` may be:

.. program-output:: python ../examples/python/filter_selection.py -r select_using_filter


It is also possible to pass a list of devices using a filter string. The
example :ref:`fig-adv-device-selection` demonstrates such a use case. The
filter string ``gpu,cpu`` implies that a GPU should be selected if available,
else a CPU device should be selected.

.. _fig-adv-device-selection:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../examples/python/device_selection.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 20-21, 55-67
    :caption: Selecting a GPU Device if Available
    :linenos:

A possible output for the example :ref:`fig-adv-device-selection` may be:

.. program-output:: python ../examples/python/device_selection.py -r create_gpu_device_if_present

.. Note::
    A **filter string** is a three-tuple that may specify the *backend*,
    *device type*, and *device number* as a colon (:) separated string. The
    backend specifies the type of device driver and can have a value such as
    *opencl*, *level-zero*, or *cuda*. The device type can be *gpu*, *cpu*,
    *accelerator*. And, the device number is a numeric value specifying the
    ordinality of the device in the listing of devices as determined by the SYCL
    runtime. The filter values are dependent of what the underlying SYCL runtime
    supports.

    Each of the backend, device type, and device number value is optional, but
    at least one of them should be provided, *i.e.*, ``opencl:gpu:0``,
    ``gpu:0``, ``gpu``, ``0``, and ``opencl:0`` are all valid filter strings.

    Please refer `oneAPI filter selection extension`_ for more details.

Advanced Device Selection
-------------------------

Till now we have discussed device selection using methods that defer the
selection logic to the SYCL runtime. However, real-world applications may
require more precise control over device selection. Dpctl offers a way for users
to accomplish more advanced device selection.

.. _fig-custom-device-selection:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../examples/python/device_selection.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 20-21, 70-91
    :caption: Custom Device Selection
    :linenos:

The example :ref:`fig-custom-device-selection` shows a way of selecting a device
based off a specific hardware property. The :func:`dpctl.get_devices()` returns
a list of all devices on the system, out of that list the devices that support
half-precision floating-point arithmetic are selected. Finally, a "score"
computed using the SYCL runtime's default device scoring logic that is stored in
:attr:`dpctl.SyclDevice.default_selector_score` is used to select a single
device. Refer the documentation of :class:`dpctl.SyclDevice` for a list of
hardware properties that may be used for device selection.

A convenience function :func:`dpctl.select_device_with_aspects()` is available
that makes it easy to select a device based on a set of specific aspects. The
example :ref:`fig-select-device-with-aspects` selects a GPU device that
supports double precision arithmetic and SYCL USM shared memory allocation.

    :language: python
    :lines: 20-21, 94-103
    :caption: Device Selection Using Aspects
    :linenos:

A possible output for the example :ref:`fig-select-device-with-aspects` may be:

.. program-output:: python ../examples/python/device_selection.py -r create_device_with_aspects
