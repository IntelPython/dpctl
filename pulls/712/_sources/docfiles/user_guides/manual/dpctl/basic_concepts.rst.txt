Basic Concepts
==============

The section introduces the basic concepts for XPU management used by dpctl.
As dpctl is based on SYCL the concepts should be familiar to users with prior
experience with SYCL. However, users of dpctl need not have any prior experience
with SYCL and the concepts presented here should be self-sufficient. We do not
go into all the SYCL-level details here and if needed readers should refer to a
more topical SYCL reference such as the `SYCL 2020 spec`_.

* **Heterogeneous computing**
    Refers to using multiple devices in a program.

* **Host**
    Every program starts by running on a host, and most of the lines of code in
    a program, in particular lines of code implementing the Python interpreter
    itself, are usually for the host. Hosts are customarily CPUs.

* **Device**
    A device is an XPU connected to a host that is programmable with a specific
    device driver. Different types of devices can have different architectures
    (CPUs, GPUs, FPGA, ASICs, DSP), but are programmable using the same
    `oneAPI`_  programming model.

* **Platform**
    A device driver installed on the system is termed as a platform. As multiple
    devices of the same type can share the same device driver, a platform may
    contain multiple devices. Note that the same physical hardware (say, a GPU)
    may be reflected as two separate devices if they can be programmed by more
    than one platform, *e.g.*, the same GPU hardware can be listed as an
    OpenCL GPU device and a Level-Zero GPU device.

* **Context**
   A context holds the run-time information needed to operate on a device or a
   group of devices.

* **Queue**
   A queue is needed to execute any computation on a device.

* **Event**
   *Needs updating*

* **USM**
   *Needs updating*
