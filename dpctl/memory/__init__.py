    **Data Parallel Control Memory**

    `dpctl.memory` provides Python objects for untyped USM memory
    container of bytes for each kind of USM pointers: shared pointers,
    device pointers and host pointers.

    Shared and host pointers are accessible from both host and a device,
    while device pointers are only accessible from device.

    Python objects corresponding to shared and host pointers implement
    Python simple buffer protocol. It is therefore possible to use these
    objects to maniputalate USM memory using NumPy or `bytearray`,
    `memoryview`, or `array.array` classes.
