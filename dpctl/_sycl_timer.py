__doc__ = "This module implements :class:`dpctl.SyclTimer`."


class SyclTimer:
    """
    SyclTimer(host_timer=timeit.default_timer, time_scale=1)
    Python class to measure device time of execution of commands submitted to
    :class:`dpctl.SyclQueue` as well as the wall-time.

    :Example:
        .. code-block:: python

            import dpctl

            # Create a default SyclQueue
            q = dpctl.SyclQueue(property='enable_profiling')

            # create the timer
            miliseconds_sc = 1e-3
            timer = dpctl.SyclTimer(time_scale = miliseconds_sc)

            # use the timer
            with timer(queue=q):
                code_block

            # retrieve elapsed times in miliseconds
            sycl_dt, wall_dt = timer.dt

    Remark:
        The timer submits barriers to the queue at the entrance and the
        exit of the context and uses profiling information from events
        associated with these submissions to perform the timing. Thus
        :class:`dpctl.SyclTimer` requires the queue with "enable_profiling"
        property. In order to be able to collect the profiling information
        the property `dt` ensures that both submitted barriers complete
        their execution and thus effectively synchronizing the queue.

    Args:
        host_timer (callable): A callable such that host_timer() returns current
            host time in seconds.
        time_scale (int, float): Ratio of the unit of time of interest and
            one second.
