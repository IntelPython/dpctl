    **Data Parallel Tensor Collection**

    ``dpctl.tensor`` is an experimental collection of tensor implementations
    that will implement future Python data API
    (https://data-apis.github.io/array-api/latest/).

    Available tensor implementations:

    ``numpy_usm_shared``:
        Provides a ``numpy.ndarray`` sub-class whose underlying memory buffer
        is allocated with a USM shared memory allocator.
