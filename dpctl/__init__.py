"""
    **Data Parallel Control (dpctl)** is a Python abstraction layer over SYCL.

    Dpctl implements a subset of SYCL's API providing wrappers for the
    SYCL runtime classes described in `Section 4.6`_ of the `SYCL 2020 spec`_.
    Note that the SYCL ``device_selector`` class is not implemented, instead
    there are device selection helper functions that can be used to simulate
    the same behavior. Dpctl implements the ``ONEPI::filter_selector`` extension
    that is included in Intel's DPC++ SYCL compiler.

    The module also includes a global SYCL queue manager. The queue manager
    provides convenience functions to create a global instance of
    a :class:`dpctl.SyclQueue`, to create a nested stack of queue objects, and
    to create a queue object for use only within a specific scope.
