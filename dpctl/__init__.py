    Data Parallel Control (dpCtl)

    dpCtl provides a lightweight Python abstraction over DPC++/SYCL and
    OpenCL runtime objects. The DPC++ runtime wrapper objects can be
    accessed by importing dpctl. The OpenCL runtime wrapper objects can be
    accessed by importing dpctl.ocldrv. The library is in an early-beta
    stage of development and not yet ready for production usage.

    dpCtl's intended usage is as a common SYCL interoperability layer for
    different Python libraries and applications. The OpenCL support inside
    PyDPPL is slated to be deprecated and then removed in future releases
    of the library.

    Currently, only a small subset of DPC++ runtime objects are exposed
    through the dpctl module. The main API classes are defined in the _sycl_core.pyx file.

    Please use `pydoc dpctl._sycl_core` to look at the current API for dpctl.

    Please use `pydoc dpctl.ocldrv` to look at the current API for dpctl.ocldrv.
