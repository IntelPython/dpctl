Example pybind11 extension demonstrating binding of dpctl entities to
SYCL entities.

dpctl provides type casters that bind ``sycl::kernel`` to
`dpctl.program.SyclKernel`, ``sycl::device`` to `dpctl.SyclDevice`, etc.

Use of these type casters simplifies writing of Python extensions and compile
then using SYCL C++ compilers, such as Intel(R) oneAPI DPC++ compiler.
